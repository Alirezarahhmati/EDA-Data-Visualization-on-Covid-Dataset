## Introduction :

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a global health crisis that has profoundly affected populations around the world. Amidst the myriad factors influencing the severity and outcome of COVID-19 cases, understanding the potential correlation between smoking rates and total deaths is of considerable interest. This project embarks on an exploratory data analysis (EDA) journey using a comprehensive COVID-19 dataset to unravel insights into the relationship between smoking habits and the impact on mortality rates.

The dataset under scrutiny encompasses a wealth of information, spanning various countries, territories, and regions. Key variables such as "male\_smokers," "female\_smokers," and "total\_deaths\_per\_million" provide crucial insights into the potential associations between smoking prevalence and COVID-19-related fatalities. Leveraging statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, this project aims to shed light on whether a correlation exists between smoking rates and the severity of the pandemic's impact on different populations. The investigation unfolds with an examination of the overall distribution of COVID-19 cases, identifying the highest-impacted countries and regions. Subsequently, the focus narrows down to the examination of smoking habits, introducing scatter plots to visualize the correlation between male and female smoking rates and total deaths. Further analysis involves exploring the correlation coefficients and patterns through pair plots, offering a comprehensive overview of the relationships between these critical variables.

The findings from this project not only contribute to our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic but also provide valuable insights for public health initiatives and policies. By examining the intricate interplay between smoking habits and mortality rates, we strive to contribute to the ongoing dialogue on effective strategies to mitigate the impact of the virus on global populations.

## Data Preprocessing :

Initially, we undertook the task of cleaning our dataset, addressing missing values, and managing outliers.

Firstly, let's examine the presence of missing values within our dataset and review the characteristics of our columns.

We observe a significant number of missing values in certain columns, considering the overall size of our dataset. Given the relatively modest dataset size, outright removal of entries with missing values may not be the most suitable approach. Instead, our strategy involves tailoring specific methods to handle missing values for each column individually.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that missing values in the "continent" column might be compensated for by information present in the "location" column for certain rows. These entries in the "location" column may contain continent-related values. As part of our data handling strategy, we will explore leveraging this information to fill in the missing values in the "continent" column wherever applicable.

We have addressed missing values in the "continent" column by employing a strategy that leverages information from the "location" column where applicable. This approach enables us to fill in missing continent values based on the content of the corresponding "location" entries.

In certain numerical columns of the dataset, particularly those indicative of cumulative counts such as "total\_cases," the absence of data in the initial stages of the pandemic collection period results in null values. To address this, we have implemented a strategy in our code to substitute these null values with zeros, considering that no data was collected during these early time points.

For columns like "population\_density" and "median age," where missing values were encountered, we opted to impute these null values with the mean of their respective columns. This strategy allows us to fill in the missing data points with a representative measure, contributing to a more comprehensive analysis while preserving the integrity of our dataset.

Additionally, we have standardized the format of the date column by converting it to the datetime standard. This ensures consistency and facilitates seamless temporal analysis within our dataset.

Concluding our data preprocessing efforts, we have successfully cleaned and prepared the columns for analysis. The handling of missing values, outliers, and the application of appropriate strategies tailored to each column have resulted in a refined dataset that is now primed for further exploration and insights.
